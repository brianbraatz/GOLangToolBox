## Go Data Types

Data type is an important concept in programming. Data type specifies the size and type of variable values.

Go is statically typed, meaning that once a variable type is defined, it can only store data of that type.

Go has three basic data types:

-   **bool**: represents a boolean value and is either true or false
-   **Numeric**: represents integer types, floating point values, and complex types
-   **string**: represents a string value

### Example

This example shows some of the different data types in Go:

package main  
import ("fmt")  
  
func main() {  
  var a bool = true       var b int = 5           
  var c float32 = 3.14    
  var d string = "Hi!"    
  
  fmt.Println("Boolean: ", a)  
  fmt.Println("Integer: ", b)  
  fmt.Println("Float:   ", c)  
  fmt.Println("String:  ", d)  
}
