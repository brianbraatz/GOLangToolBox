# Best Go Tutorials in Town

It's been a couple of months that I started to learn Go. I'm basically binge watching any tutorial I can find on youtube. And I gotta say that I completed a bunch. Today I want to share 2 channels with you that I think are great compared to others:

-   The first one is going through almost all of the concepts in go in an elaborate way. The tutor is very clear. Videos are a little bit long compared to other tutorials but I believe it worths your time. Because in every video he manages to squeeze in some things that I haven't came across before. It's definitely beginner friendly and it will get you up to speed with a great knowledge base. Generally, I watch tutorials at 1.5x-2x speed, but that was one of the few tutorials that I watched at 1x speed, because it's packed with a lot of knowledge and insight.

-   The second channel is a little bit more advanced in terms of the topics it covers. The tutor I think is an ex-Google and current Apple engineer. He basically picks a concept/mini project/ idea for each video and tries to implement it as if it's a production environment. I gotta say I learned a lot from that channel as well
    

[just for func](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL64wiCrrxh4Jisi7OcCJIUpguV_f5jGnZ)

So, that's it. That's all my hours spent watching tutorials to find out the best ones. Take it as my payback to the community. I hope it will be helpful for newcomers.

Feel free to add tutorials below that you can vouch for and think they worth the while.

Edit after 6 months:

There is one more channel that I found worth mentioning and it is:

-   [Go Class](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoILbKo9rG3skRCj37Kn5Zj803hhiuRK6) by Matt KØDVB
    

It's almost like the first source above but gives a more academic vibes. The part I liked about it is that after introducing topics it goes ahead and gives small coding sessions. Those sessions themself actually teach a lot about the logic and conventions of Go programming. So highly recommend that one as well.

Great suggestions. In particular, I rate these (I have been learning Go):

Bill Kennedy's (Ardan Labs) [Go Syntax YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLADD_vxzPcZATO4tDU_nHApxTEJyxskiS) - helped introduce me to the basics of Go (as well as [Go's standard learning resources](https://go.dev/learn/) e.g. Tour of Go); I wish Bill would provide more content like this (a superb educator; many people rate his training courses).

Jon Calhoun's [Web Development with Go (2021) YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVEltXlEeWgkKucovAMCih4T0hQITxRX3) - as understanding the basics e.g. handlerFunc are key, and Jon does an excellent job of taking a newbie through getting started in the Go ecosystem for web development.

As you progress in your learning, then you may appreciate the generous sharing of Eli Bendersky's ('[eli.thegreenplace.net](https://eli.thegreenplace.net)') understanding of systems programming, so many useful and thoughtful blog posts including [REST Servers in Go series](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2021/rest-servers-in-go-part-1-standard-library/) and refactoring (and key design decisions) from going from Go's standard library to using third-party packages. Assessing the quality of learning material is always challenging (as many factors)- where Eli shines is their excellent understanding of Go (as well as C/C++, Python, Perl, and many more- see ~20 years of blog posts) and balanced and clear presentation.

I second this. This was a groundbreaking book for me, teaching me TDD at the same time as learning golang at a fast pace.

For people interested in concurrency and internals of Go.

"Concurrency In Go" by Katherine is nice and practicing it gives hold over common patterns like generator, fan-in-fan-out multiplexing, using hearbeats, workings of work-stealing algorithm, etc.

GopherCon - 2017, Channels, Scheduler Saga, Lock videos by Kavya Joshi are nice to understand internals of Go.

You can also browse any OSS repos to look for design patterns in Go.

One good resource to **learn to create project in Golang** I found on YouTube is this channel:

[https://www.youtube.com/c/AkhilSharmaTech/featured](https://www.youtube.com/c/AkhilSharmaTech/featured)

The channel doesn't focus on very basic of the go programming language such as syntax and data types, but has projects on **GO** that are beginner friendly .

The channel is more of what next after learning the golang.

The Power of Go Tools is a pretty good book for beginners imo. It's doesn't go over syntax, but instead talks about how to write testable code (it's tdd), how to write apis/packages that are easy to use, etc. It's not groundbreaking, but there's little nuggets here and there that I thought were helpful. Particularly writing your packages to be used in the simplest case, like how the net/http package is used. You have the option to do http.Get, which creates a basic client for you and takes care of paperwork for you, or you can create the client yourself then use Get. Just little things like that make your packages that much more usable. Maybe this is obvious to others, but wasn't to me.

Hey there!

There are excellent resources here, but I hope I can contribute too. I am a DevAdvocate for MongoDB and have created 3 videos with a very simple introduction to HTTP servers with 1.22, persistence, and concurrency (goroutines and channels) to do a graceful shutdown. Hope they help!

Thanks for this. I work mainly in Ruby and JS and some of our microservices are in Go and I find myself to be pretty weak in Go. I'm always grokking my way out of things.

I am a full stack javascript engineer. I have been trying to branch out either to learn product development and build something of my own or learn more on the cloud and do more of freelancing on side. From my first job (5 years back) I came across microservices in GoLang but never directly worked on/with it (consumed it on Frontend).

I have found this resource, I'm shy to share here as no one has mentioned it. [https://gophercises.com/](https://gophercises.com/)
