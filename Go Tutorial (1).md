**Go language** is a programming language initially developed at Google in the year 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is a statically-typed language having syntax similar to that of C. It provides garbage collection, type safety, dynamic-typing capability, many advanced built-in types such as variable length arrays and key-value maps. It also provides a rich standard library. The Go programming language was launched in November 2009 and is used in some of the Google's production systems.

This **Go language tutorial** is created by experienced Go masters after considering in-depth the knowledge of both beginners and professional programmers. This tutorial is simply structured with a step-by-step approach; it eases learning by using practical examples to draw out key concepts. Also, it serves as a fully hands-on guide capturing the syntax and unique features of Golang, enabling software developers to learn and practice building, managing, and optimizing applications with confidence and proficiency.

## Why to Learn Golang?

It is the most important programming language that any student or professional dreams about becoming a master in software development to have those fantastic programming skills. Some of the tough, long reasons why studying the language is worth it are:

-   Golang was created for simplicity and effectiveness, empowering developers to create clean, maintainable code while implementing very complex systems.
-   It gives built-in concurrency support via goroutines and channels that facilitate the writing of scalable applications of high performance.
-   The fundamental design of Golang prioritizes readability, thus simplifying coding and comprehension of the code.
-   The standard library of Golang is widespread, so sophisticated applications can be created without reliance on other libraries.
-   Golang comes with a cross-platform compatibility feature, and hence the code can run across many operating systems, be it [Windows](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/windows10/index.htm), [Linux](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/index.htm), or [macOS](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/macos/index.htm).
-   The language assists in developer productivity using a defer for resource management, specialty error handling, and in-built garbage collection.

## Hello World in Go Language

Here is the simple Go language example to print "Hello, World!" on the screen. You can RUN and Edit this example by clicking on **Edit & Run** button.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

## Go Language Features

These qualities combine to make Golang a strong and efficient language for constructing modern software applications.

-   **Concurrency with Goroutines and Channels:** Golang simplifies concurrent programming by utilizing lightweight goroutines and channels for communication, resulting in scalable and efficient code.
-   **Rich Standard Library:** Go has a strong built-in library, which consists of facilities that allow I/O networking and data manipulation so that a developer may get rid of all third-party libraries.
-   **Defer Statement:** The defer statement makes sure that the function will run after the surrounding function execution has been completed and is good for resource management.
-   **Cross-Platform Development:** With Go, you can build applications that run on different operating platforms using a single code base in Windows, Linux, and macOS.
-   **Error Handling:** The explicit error-handling system of Golang highlights that it returns error values to be typical code development practices for developing robust and trustable programs.
-   **Garbage Collection:** The integrated garbage collector automatically manages memory and reduces memory leaks via its uncomplicated memory management system. End memory storage.

Well, learning Golang will put strong talents in the hands of developers so that they can build performant, scalable applications quickly and easily. Its simple rollout concurrency architecture, along with its developing ecosystem, makes it a great option for current program implementations.

## Audience: Who Can Learn Go Language?

This tutorial is designed for software programmers with a need to understand the Go programming language from scratch. This tutorial will give you enough understanding on Go programming language from where you can take yourself to higher levels of expertise.

## Prerequisites to Learn Go Language
