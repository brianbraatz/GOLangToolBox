## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

In the example below, we use the **assignment** operator (`=`) to assign the value **10** to a variable called **x**:

### Example

package main  
import ("fmt")

func main() {  
  var x = 10  
  fmt.Println(x)  
}

The **addition assignment** operator (`+=`) adds a value to a variable:

### Example

package main  
import ("fmt")  
  
func main() {  
  var x = 10  
  x +=5  
  fmt.Println(x)  
}
