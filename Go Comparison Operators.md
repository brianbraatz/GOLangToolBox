## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values.

**Note:** The return value of a comparison is either true (`1`) or false (`0`).

In the following example, we use the **greater than** operator (`>`) to find out if 5 is greater than 3:

### Example

package main  
import ("fmt")

func main() {  
  var x = 5  
  var y = 3  
  fmt.Println(x>y) }
