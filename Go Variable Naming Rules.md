## Go Variable Naming Rules

A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, price, carname, etc.).

Go variable naming rules:

-   A variable name must start with a letter or an underscore character (\_)
-   A variable name cannot start with a digit
-   A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (`a-z, A-Z`, `0-9`, and `_` )
-   Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
-   There is no limit on the length of the variable name
-   A variable name cannot contain spaces
-   The variable name cannot be any Go keywords

___

## Multi-Word Variable Names

Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.

There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

## Camel Case

Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:

myVariableName = "John"

___

## Pascal Case

Each word starts with a capital letter:

MyVariableName = "John"

___

## Snake Case

Each word is separated by an underscore character:

my\_variable\_name = "John"
