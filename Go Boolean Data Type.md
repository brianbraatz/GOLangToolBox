## Go Boolean Data Type

___

## Boolean Data Type

A boolean data type is declared with the `bool` keyword and can only take the values `true` or `false`.

The default value of a boolean data type is `false`.

### Example

This example shows some different ways to declare Boolean variables:

package main  
import ("fmt")

func main() {  
  var b1 bool = true

  var b2 = true  
  var b3 bool  
  b4 := true  
  
  fmt.Println(b1)  
  fmt.Println(b2)  
  fmt.Println(b3)  
  fmt.Println(b4)  
}

**Note:** Boolean values are mostly used for conditional testing which you will learn more about in the [Go Conditions](https://www.w3schools.com/go/go_conditions.php) chapter.
