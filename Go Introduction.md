-   Developing network-based programs
-   Developing cross-platform enterprise applications
-   Cloud-native development

___

## Why Use Go?

## Go Compared to Python and C++

| Go | [Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) | [C++](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Statically typed | Dynamically typed | Statically typed |
| Fast run time | Slow run time | Fast run time |
| Compiled | Interpreted | Compiled |
| Fast compile time | Interpreted | Slow compile time |
| Supports concurrency through goroutines and channel | No built-in concurrency mechanism | Supports concurrency through threads |
| Has automatic garbage collection | Has automatic garbage collection | Does not have automatic garbage collection |
| Does not support classes and objects | Has classes and objects | Has classes and objects |
| Does not support inheritance | Supports inheritance | Supports inheritance |

**Notes:**

-   Compilation time refers to translating the code into an executable program
-   Concurrency is performing multiple things out-of-order, or at the same time, without affecting the final outcome
-   Statically typed means that the variable types are known at compile time
