## Go Conditions

Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

## Go Conditions

A condition can be either `true` or `false`.

Go supports the usual [comparison operators](https://www.w3schools.com/go/go_comparison_operators.php) from mathematics:

-   Less than `<`
-   Less than or equal `<=`
-   Greater than `>`
-   Greater than or equal `>=`
-   Equal to `==`
-   Not equal to `!=`

Additionally, Go supports the usual [logical operators](https://www.w3schools.com/go/go_logical_operators.php):

-   Logical AND `&&`
-   Logical OR `||`
-   Logical NOT `!`

You can use these operators or their combinations to create conditions for different decisions.

Go has the following conditional statements:

-   Use `if` to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
-   Use `else` to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
-   Use `else if` to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
-   Use `switch` to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
